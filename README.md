Introduction
The Advanced Data Visualization Platform is a web-based application developed using Python, Dash, and Plotly. This platform empowers users to upload their datasets in CSV or Excel format and visualize the data through various interactive plots. It aims to simplify data analysis and make insights more accessible for both beginners and experienced users.

Features
File Upload: Easily upload your data in CSV or Excel formats.
Data Visualization: Generate a variety of plots, including:
3D Surface Plots
Line Charts
Bar Charts
Scatter Plots
Interactive Filtering: Select which columns to display and visualize for a more tailored analysis experience.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for intuitive navigation and usability, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for development.
Dash: A web framework for building analytical web applications.
Plotly: A library for creating interactive plots and graphs.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/viennataylor2001/advanced-data-visualization.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd advanced-data-visualization
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to access the platform.

Upload your data: Drag and drop your CSV or Excel file into the designated area.

Visualize your data: Select the desired plot type and interact with the visualizations.

How It Works
The application leverages Dash to create a web interface that interacts with Plotly for rendering graphs. Upon file upload, the app reads the data using Pandas, processes it, and allows users to select different visualization options. Users can also filter the displayed data based on their selections, making analysis more dynamic and user-driven.
